                <h2>Vipassana meditation</h2>
                <p>If you’re interested in trying Vipassana meditation at home, follow these steps:</p>
                <h3>Steps To Perform :</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.	Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to practice. It’s recommended that you do Vipassana when you first wake up in the morning.</li>
                    <li>2.	Choose a quiet area with little to no distractions. An empty room or a secluded spot outside are great choices.</li>
                    <li>3.	Sit on the ground. Cross your legs in a comfortable position. Engage your core, straighten your back, and relax your body.</li>
                    <li>4.	Close your eyes and breathe normally. Focus on your natural breath and what you feel.</li>
                    <li>5.	Be mindful of each inhale and exhale. Observe your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without reacting or judging.</li>
                    <li>6.	If you become distracted, simply observe the distraction and return to your breath.</li>
                    <li>7.	Aim to do this for at least 5 to 10 minutes when you first start. As you get used to this practice, work up to 15 minutes or longer of Vipassana meditation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The bottom line:</h2>
                <p>Vipassana is an ancient mindfulness meditation technique. It involves observing your thoughts and emotions as they are, without judging or dwelling on them.</p>
                <p>Though more studies are needed, research to date has found that Vipassana can reduce stress and anxiety, which may have benefits for substance use. It may also promote brain plasticity.</p>
                <p>To get started with Vipassana, begin with 5- to 10-minute sessions in a quiet space. Slowly increase this to 15 minutes or longer as you get used to this form of meditation. You can also listen to audio recordings or attend a class for guided mediations.</p>
