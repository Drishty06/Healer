# What is this all about? 👀
* Project Healer is a website which aims on discovering a healthier and a better version of yourself.

# What's the issue we are trying to solve? 👈
* Hustle and bustle in everyday life has made our life so hectic that we almost never spend time for ourselves and as a result of that, it degrades our mental, physical as well as emotional health. Engrossed in the work for hours and working sitting in same posture for hours in this online era due to covid has somehow degraded the lifestyle of many. More stress, work pressure, blooming rise in use of social media, Reduced face-to-face interactions and social supports due to covid - reasons like these sums up to drastic rise in mental health problems these days.
* Additionally, due to above mentioned reasons, agressiveness and anger are highly common which actually affects the body negatively to a greater extent.
* Spending even few minutes to dive into innerself can curb many of such issues.

# Challenges we faced 😵 and how we tried to tackle them ! 🤓💪
Since all of us are beginners and this being our first hackathon, We faced challenges like:
* Making the website responsive - we tried to work on our code so that it can fit any device.
* Developing the Hack in 36 hours ! - this being the first hackathon we faced challenges in managing the time and implement all the features, but later sacrificing the sleep and working with dedication in teams helped to implement all the features we planned within the time limit.
* Since we wanted to include useful content, so including well researched content in such shorter span was another bigggest challenge we faced. To tackle this we divided the work and sacrificed sleep so as to provide well researched content to the users.

# Future Plans of Project Healer 📝
* Providing peronalized content so as to provide personal training to users based on their taste and working on Backend.
* To include the feature where the user can anonymously talk and share their problems to get lighter.
* To include more games which aims on providing relaxation from stress and negativity and can bloom positivity.
